export const TEMP_MESSAGE = `Okay\\! Here's a Markdown message, showcasing various syntax elements:

***

_Welcome\\! ðŸŽ‰_

This is a test message demonstrating Markdown formatting\\. Let's dive in\\!

_Section 1: Text Formatting_

We can make text _bold_, _italic_, or __both\\!__

You can also use a strikethrough: ~This text is crossed out\\.~

_Section 2: Lists_

Here are some different list styles:

â€¢   Bullet point one
â€¢   Bullet point two
â€¢   Sub\\-item
â€¢   Another sub\\-item
â€¢   Bullet point three

And now a numbered list:

1\\.  First item
2\\.  Second item
3\\.  Third item

_Section 3: Code & Quotes_

Let's include a code snippet:

\`\`\`
def greet(name):
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
\`\`\`

And a blockquote:

\\> This is a quote\\. It's a great way to emphasize important information\\. "Attitude is a choice\\." \\-  Anonymous

You can also show inline code snippets like this: \`print("Hello World")\`

_Section 4: Links & Images \\(Simulated\\)_

Here's a link to [Google](https://www.google.com)\\.

And a placeholder for an image: \`![Descriptive text about the image](image_url.jpg)\` \\(Replace \`image_url.jpg\` with the actual image URL if you're using a Markdown editor that supports image display\\.\\)

***

That covers a good range of Markdown syntax\\!  Let me know if you'd like me to try anything else\\. ðŸ™‚`;
